## Notes:
Because the Unity Project itself was not properly uploading to git, I exported the project as a package, however, this means there are a few extra set-up steps:
1. You will have to import the package into an empty 3D core project. Make sure all items in the package are imported.
2. You will probably have to download the Varjo package. You can do so through Unity's Package Manager under Window, and the link to the github with the package is listed in the Quick Links section above. A more detailed tutorial is also listed.
3. You will have to create an empty folder in Assets named "outfiles" (for storing orb path)
